			<div id="about-me">
				<p>Hi! I'm Rachel, a web applications developer with nine years of experience delivering high-quality
					web solutions to higher education clients.</p>
			   <p>I'm especially skilled in <em>JavaScript</em> (and <em>React</em>), <em>Python</em> (and <em>Flask</em>), 
				   and <em>WordPress</em> development. I'm passionate about mentoring, effective communication,

				<div class="project">

					<p class="project-tags">React | Sass | Bootstrap | Netlify | Personal Project</p>
					<p>This <em>React</em> application allows knitters to generate hat and sock knitting patterns based on their own custom measurements and stitch size (called "gauge").
					In addition to using the sock pattern generator in the Classic Cuff Down Socks class I teach 2-3 times a year, upwards of 50 users per week use this application.</p></div>
