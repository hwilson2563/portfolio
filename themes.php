					<h3>WordPress Themes</h3>

<p>I love to take mocked up designs and turn them into fully-featured, responsive WordPress themes.  Following is a selection of the work I have done in this both professionally and personally.</p>


					<ul class="bxslider">
                                          <li><img src="images/screenshots/robotics.png" />
                                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                                <p>I built this responsive theme to be used by College of Engineering entities with ties to other schools.  The goal was to deviate slightly from the <a href="http://www.engin.umich.edu" target="_blank">main CoE brand</a> to show that these users are not solely tied to the College of Engineering.  This was accomplished using mockups for another department and modifying them to fit the needs of this service. <a href="http://robotics.umich.edu" target="_blank">Click here to view the theme in use.</a></p>
                                          <p>&nbsp;</p></li>
                                          <li><img src="images/screenshots/bergermarks.png" />
                                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was contracted to build this responsive WordPress theme from PDF mockups created by a designer.  I also installed and configured the appropriate plugins to fit their needs. <a href="http://bergermarks.org" target="_blank">Click here to view the theme in use.</a></p>

					  <li><img src="images/screenshots/newtheme-responsive-right.png" />
					  	<p>&nbsp;</p>
					  	<p>I built this fully-responsive blog theme using starter theme <a href="http://underscores.me" target="_blank">Underscores</a> as a base for much of the functionality.  I added customization options for color schemes and a sidebar image using the Customizer API. <a href="http://blog.rachelleggett.com" target="_blank">Click here to view the theme in use.</a></p>
